# BLE Implementation Guidelines

1. Device Discovery:
   - Observe other BLE devices
   - Collect MAC addresses and RSSI values
   - Filter for specific advertisement names: "JUXTA_XXXX"
   - XXXX must be last four characters of device MAC

2. Timing Requirements:
   - Fixed rate advertising
   - Duty-cycled observation (e.g., 5s scan every 30s)

3. Gateway Connectivity:
   - Devices must connect to gateway
   - Gateway interaction for:
     - Settings retrieval
     - Data transfer

4. Implementation References:
   - Check `/samples/ble/` for reference implementations
   - Particularly observer and peripheral examples
