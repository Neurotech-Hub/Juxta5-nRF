# Vitals and Memory Implementation Guidelines

1. FRAM Memory Operations:
   - Use MB85RS1M FRAM chip
   - Hardware layer: `juxta_fram` library
   - File system layer: `juxta_framfs` library
   - Follow library documentation for all operations

2. Vitals Implementation (`juxta_vitals_nrf52`):
   - Device Voltage:
     - Use internal ADC
     - Measure VDD
   - RTC Operations:
     - Accept unix timestamps for setting
     - No direct BLE interaction
     - Functions should default to passing RTC parameter
     - Functions without RTC parameter are special cases

3. File System Testing:
   - Check file system statistics before operations
   - Clear file system before fresh tests
   - Monitor used and remaining space
