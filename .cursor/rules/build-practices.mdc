# Build and Development Practices

1. Never attempt to build applications or run build commands. The user exclusively builds using VS Code's nRF extension.
2. Make minimal, incremental changes that can be quickly tested.
3. Let the user handle all builds and testing.
4. Never modify git state - only use git status and git diff for information.
5. Always use RTT (Real Time Transfer) for debugging output - never use UART or other console methods.
6. For complex problems:
   - Present technical strategies first
   - Ask clarifying questions before coding
   - Break down into smaller testable units
