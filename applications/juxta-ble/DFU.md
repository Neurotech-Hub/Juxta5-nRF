## Firmware Updates (DFU) over BLE for juxta-ble on Juxta5-4_nRF52840

This document outlines a simple, robust path to enable over-the-air firmware updates using Zephyr MCUboot and MCUmgr (SMP over BLE), aligned with the device’s magnet-based activation flow and without changing the existing `ble_service.c` logic.

### Overview
- **Transport/Protocol**: MCUmgr SMP service over BLE (standard GATT service) with MCUboot two-slot image swap.
- **Security**: No authentication (in-house/dev use). SMP is only exposed when the device explicitly enters DFU mode.
- **User Flow**: DFU mode is entered via a long magnet hold at boot; normal program starts otherwise.

### Explicit Mode Selection at Boot
- **Magnet <1s**: Normal program (current flow). Connectable datetime sync, then full system init; Hublink service runs as usual.
- **Magnet >5s**: DFU mode. Minimal initialization to expose the MCUmgr BLE SMP service for image upload; no app services are started. After upload, reset to boot the new image.

### What stays unchanged
- `applications/juxta-ble/src/ble_service.c` remains intact and is used only in normal mode.
- No image staging in FRAM is required; MCUmgr writes directly to the secondary flash slot.
- Board partitions are already suitable for MCUboot two-slot swaps.

### Files to adjust
- `applications/juxta-ble/prj.conf` ✅ **UPDATED**
  - Enable MCUboot (bootloader, two-slot swap) and MCUmgr core with BLE transport.
  - Enable image and OS management groups.
  - Keep `CONFIG_BT_SMP=n` for unauthenticated DFU (development/in-house).
  - Optional later: tune BLE/MCUmgr buffers if throughput is insufficient; current ATT_MTU 247 is acceptable to start.

- `applications/juxta-ble/child_image/mcuboot.conf` ✅ **UPDATED**
  - Configure MCUboot signing (RSA-2048) and swap policy (test-then-confirm by default).
  - Point to the local private key file used for signing. Do not commit private keys.

- Local signing key (not in repo) ✅ **SCRIPT PROVIDED**
  - Generate an RSA-2048 keypair for signing. The build uses this to produce signed images (`app_update.bin` / `zephyr.signed.bin`).
  - Use the provided `generate_signing_key.sh` script to create keys.

- `applications/juxta-ble/src/main.c`
  - Add magnet-hold timing check at the very start of `main()` (before BLE/vitals/FRAM init):
    - If **<1s**: follow current program as-is (datetime sync, Hublink, state machine).
    - If **>5s**: enter **DFU mode**:
      - Initialize BLE only; register MCUmgr SMP over BLE.
      - Start connectable advertising; optionally include the SMP service UUID in advertising data.
      - Do not initialize FRAMFS, LIS2DH, ADC, or the state machine.
      - Ensure the watchdog continues to be fed (and consider a longer timeout during DFU).
      - Log clear DFU-mode status and keep the system idle except for BLE.
  - On next boot after update: simplest path is to auto-confirm success early in normal mode (optional), otherwise just re-enter the normal magnet gate and proceed.

- Optional docs
  - Add a short note in `applications/juxta-ble/HUBLINK.md` that DFU mode is entered by holding the magnet for >5s at boot and is handled via the standard MCUmgr SMP BLE service.

### User workflow (no auth)
1. Power the device while holding the magnet for >5s → device enters DFU mode and advertises as usual (now with SMP service available).
2. Use your preferred tool (e.g., MCUmgr CLI or a Nordic mobile app that supports MCUmgr) to:
   - List images (slot-0/slot-1),
   - Upload the signed image,
   - Mark as test if needed (some tools do this automatically),
   - Reset the device.
3. Device boots the new image. If auto-confirm is enabled in code, the image is confirmed early; otherwise, the normal flow resumes and can confirm after health checks.

### Operational details
- **Advertising**: In DFU mode, advertise connectable; including SMP UUID is optional. Keep the existing device name convention to make discovery easy.
- **Watchdog**: Ensure the periodic feed timer runs during DFU; increase `WDT` timeout if uploads are long.
- **Throughput**: Start with current 247 MTU; only tune BLE buffer counts and MCUmgr buffers if DFU feels slow.

### Validation checklist
- Enter DFU via magnet >5s; verify SMP service is present and upload succeeds.
- Verify swap behavior: upload smaller test build, reset, ensure new app boots.
- Verify rollback safety by simulating a failure before confirm (if not using auto-confirm), ensuring MCUboot returns to the previous image.
- Verify watchdog does not reset the device during a long upload.

### Risks and mitigations
- **Unauthorized updates**: Mitigated by only exposing SMP in DFU mode via explicit magnet action; unauthenticated by design per requirements.
- **Upload disruptions**: Two-slot MCUboot swap protects against bricking; consider auto-confirm only after minimal sanity checks if desired.
- **Radio starvation**: Keep logs modest and avoid heavy peripherals in DFU mode.

### Build expectations
- Enable sysbuild so MCUboot is built alongside the app.
- Output artifacts include a signed image for DFU. Use the signed image when uploading over MCUmgr.

### Quick start steps
1. **Generate signing keys**: Run `./generate_signing_key.sh` in the `applications/juxta-ble/` directory.
2. **Enable signing**: Uncomment the signing lines in `child_image/mcuboot.conf` and update the key path.
3. **Build with sysbuild**: Use VS Code nRF extension with sysbuild enabled, or command line with `-DSYSBUILD=y`.
4. **Test DFU**: Use MCUmgr CLI or Nordic Device Manager app to upload the signed image.

### Troubleshooting
- **Kconfig errors**: Ensure `mcuboot.conf` uses valid MCUboot symbols (not application symbols).
- **Build failures**: Verify sysbuild is enabled and MCUboot is being built as a child image.
- **Signing errors**: Ensure the private key path in `mcuboot.conf` is correct and the key file exists.
- **DFU not working**: Check that MCUmgr SMP service is present in BLE scan results when in DFU mode.

This plan keeps DFU explicit, simple for users, and isolated from your application's normal services and state machine.
