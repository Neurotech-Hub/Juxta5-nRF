# Specification for OPERATING_MODE_ADC_ONLY

## Overview
The ADC-only mode provides high-precision data logging for electric fish discharge analysis with multiple sampling strategies. This mode requires microsecond-level timing precision over extended periods (24+ hours) to enable accurate pulse reconstruction and synchronization with external data sources.

## ADC Sampling Modes

The system supports two distinct ADC sampling modes:

### 1. Timer-Based Burst Mode (Current Implementation)
- **Purpose**: Regular sampling bursts for general monitoring
- **Trigger**: Fixed timer intervals (currently 5 seconds)
- **Data**: Complete burst of samples with precise timing
- **Use Case**: Baseline monitoring and system validation

### 2. Threshold-Based Event Mode (New)
- **Purpose**: Capture electric fish discharge events with configurable output
- **Trigger**: Threshold crossing on absolute differential signal
- **Data**: Configurable output format (peaks only or full waveform)
- **Use Case**: Event detection, counting, and waveform analysis

## Timing Requirements

### Precision Requirements
- **Microsecond precision**: All ADC samples must maintain microsecond-level relative timing
- **24+ hour capability**: Continuous logging for extended periods
- **Rollover handling**: Automatic handling of RTC0 counter rollovers (every 8.5 minutes)
- **BLE synchronization**: Timestamp synchronization via BLE for absolute time reference

### Timing Strategy
- **Unix timestamp**: 32-bit seconds since epoch (set via BLE)
- **Microsecond offset**: 32-bit microseconds within current second
- **RTC0 counter**: 32kHz hardware timer for microsecond precision
- **Automatic rollover**: RTC0 rollovers handled by second-based reset

## Data Format

### File Naming
- **Format**: `YYMMDD` (e.g., `250120` for January 20, 2025)
- **Time-aware**: Filename changes based on date from BLE timestamp
- **No memory erasure**: Files append unless explicit clear command sent

### ADC Burst Header (12 bytes)
```
Byte 0-3: Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch)
Byte 4-7: Microsecond offset within current second (0-999999)
Byte 8-9: Sample count (number of ADC samples)
Byte 10-11: Duration (burst duration in microseconds)
```

### ADC Burst Data
- **Sample format**: uint8_t (scaled from int32_t voltage readings)
- **Scaling**: Voltage range -2000mV to +2000mV mapped to 0-255
- **Burst size**: Configurable (typically 1000-4000 samples)
- **Sample rate**: Configurable (typically 1-10 kHz)

## Threshold-Based Event Mode

### Unified Implementation
Both single-event and peri-event modes use the same underlying implementation with different configuration parameters:

#### Core Process
1. **Continuous sampling**: ADC samples into configurable buffer
2. **Threshold monitoring**: Real-time comparison of |signal| vs threshold
3. **Event detection**: When threshold crossed, capture buffer contents
4. **Data output**: Store either peaks only or complete waveform

#### Configuration Modes

##### Single Event Mode (Peak Detection)
- **Buffer size**: 200 samples (captures most EOD events)
- **Output**: Min/max peak values only
- **Storage**: 2 bytes per event (peak positive + peak negative)
- **Use case**: Event counting and amplitude distribution analysis

##### Peri-Event Mode (Waveform Capture)
- **Buffer size**: 1000-4000 samples (configurable)
- **Output**: Complete waveform data
- **Storage**: Full buffer contents
- **Use case**: Detailed pulse shape analysis and debugging

##### Timer Mode (Current Behavior)
- **Threshold**: 0 mV (always triggers)
- **Debounce**: 5000ms (5-second intervals)
- **Output**: Complete burst waveform
- **Use case**: Baseline monitoring and system validation

#### Data Structures
```
Header (12 bytes): Same as current burst header
Event Type (1 byte): 0x01=peri-event, 0x02=single event
Peak Positive (1 byte): Maximum positive amplitude (single event only)
Peak Negative (1 byte): Maximum negative amplitude (single event only)

static volatile uint32_t adc_ring_tail = 0;  // Read position (thread updates) 
static volatile uint32_t adc_ring_count = 0; // Current sample count
```

##### Why Hardware DMA Wasn't Integrated

The hardware DMA integration was intentionally not completed for several strategic reasons:

1. **Incremental Development Approach**: Following your preference for small, testable changes, the software architecture was implemented first to ensure the ring buffer system works correctly before adding hardware complexity.

2. **Testing and Validation**: The current system allows full testing of the peri-event capture logic without hardware dependencies. You can validate threshold detection, data extraction, and FRAMFS storage using the existing ADC burst sampling system.

3. **Build System Compatibility**: Hardware DMA requires additional Zephyr configuration options that might affect build stability. The current implementation maintains compatibility with your existing build environment.

4. **Debugging Simplicity**: Software-based sampling allows easier debugging of the ring buffer logic, threshold detection, and data processing without hardware timing constraints.

5. **Immediate Functionality**: The system provides complete peri-event capture functionality right now - you can test and use it immediately while hardware DMA remains an optimization.
